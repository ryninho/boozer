Advanced search for blazer.  Work in progress.

next steps:
* get blazer id from user's instacart email address
* don't show dropdown on show_queries page
* search by both "from" and "join"
* post is good for writing something, better to use query params
* show recent queries on search page as default
* add navigation links to each page
* make it prettier with bootstrap

faq:
* errno 48 address already in use --> run 'ps -fA | grep python' and kill other processes using the port already

Refactor:
* DRY out the templates
